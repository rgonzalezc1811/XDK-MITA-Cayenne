# XDK-Workspace MITA: Cayenne

This repository only storages an example of sending data over WiFi and using the MQTT protocol to the IoT Cayenne platform.

MITA is a excellent programming lenguage to use when learning XDK and 
rapid prototyping processes on hackathones and courses.

     Note: The XDK Workbench code has been tested only on Windows 64-bits.

## General requirements

1. XDK-Workbench v3.6.1 installed, download the installer in the [Bosch developer portal](https://developer.bosch.com/web/xdk/downloads) and choose your operating system and architecture.
   
          Note: If "Your_User" name has spaces or special characters on the suggested installation path like C:\Users\Your UsÃ©r\XDK-Workbench the projects would not build. 
          
          Avoid this issue installing the XDK Workbench on a directory with no spaces or special characters path as C:\Users\XDK-Workbench or C:\XDK-Workbench.

2. XDK device with bootloader v0.0.9 or v1.2.0.
   
          Note: The bootloader v1.2.0 sometimes shows errors at flashing the device, to solve this issue only re-build the current project and try to flash again the device.

## Instructions

#### Get the projects using GIT

* To use the modules and projects of repository, clone the current repository into your **XDK-Workspace** folder, usually, the path follows the same pattern on Windows like *`C:\Users\Your_User\XDK-Workspace`* or *`C:\Your_user\XDK-Workspace`* (be careful, not confused with the installation folder, its pattern follows the structure *`C:\XDK-Workbench`*), use the next command:

     * `git clone https://github.com/rgonzalezc1811/XDK-MITA-Cayenne.git` 
  
#### Get the projects using the ZIP download

* Download the master branch *`master`* as a ZIP file.
* Unzip the file into the **XDK-Workspace** folder, usually, the path follows the same pattern on Windows like *`C:\Users\User\XDK-Workspace`* or *`C:\User\XDK-Workspace`* (be careful, not confused with the installation folder, its pattern follows the structure *`C:\XDK-Workbench`*)

#### Use a project

* Open your **XDK-Workbench**.
* Close the *Welcome* page.
* Go to *File* > *Open Projects from File System...*
* On the *Import Projects from File System or Archive* window click on *Directory...*
* Go to the *XDK-Workspace*
* In the *Browse for Folder* window, select the desired project on MITA (ble, sdcard and so on) and click on *OK*.
* On the *Import Projects from File System or Archive* window click on *Finish*
* Do right click on the MITA project main folder and go to *Properties*.
* Select *C/C++ Build*.
* Click on *Behavior*.
* Click in *Enable parallel build*.
* Select *Use optimal jobs (#)*, that option has the better performance.
* Select the root project folder and right click.
* Select *Build Project*
* When building is finished, go to **XDK Devices** and click in *Flash* 

##### Use a project by copying only the *application.mita* file

* Open your **XDK-Workbench**.
* Close the *Welcome* page.
* Create a new *MITA project* in the **XDK-Workbench**
    1. Go to *File* >  *New* > *Project...*
    2. Select *XDK* > *Eclipse Mita project* and click on *Next >*
    3. Name it as the current MITA project to copy in the text box *Project name:*
    4. Click on *Finish*
* Browse to the desired project in the remote repository.
* Copy the text of the *application.mita* file
* Paste the text into your *application.mita* generated in the local MITA project.
* Do right click on the MITA project main folder and go to *Properties*.
* Select *C/C++ Build*.
* Click on *Behavior*.
* Click in *Enable parallel build*.
* Select *Use optimal jobs (#)*, that option has the better performance.
* Select the root project folder and right click.
* Select *Build Project*
* When building is finished, go to **XDK Devices** and click in *Flash*

## Version notes v.1.1.0

* Bootloader v.0.0.9 has better performance than v.1.2.0, try to use always the previous version.

* Avoid using spaces or special characters on the instalation path, the XDK-Workspace path or new project names.

* Some WiFi codes are not working in some XDK hardware, some of the causes are still unknown.

## Project status

The project is a own work to have all the XDK base codes for events, hack developments and rapid prototyping.
